# Monkey Lad

### A simple platformer pygame zero project. <br/>
### Defeat enemies, get coins, and win by getting the treasure chest! <br/>

## HOW TO PLAY 

### Jump through the platforms to reach the chest, avoid enemies or punch them; <br/>
### Don't collide with an enemy without punching, or you lose !<br/>
### You have three enemy types to avoid: Snakes, Falcons and Scorpions. <br/>
### Snakes are rather fast and walk left and right on a large space. <br/>
### Scorpions are slow and only walk a small region. <br/>
### Falcons are quite fast and are on the air between platforms! <br/>

## CONTROLS 

### SPACEBAR = JUMP
### Z = PUNCH ( KILLS ENEMIES )
### ARROWS = MOVE

### So what are you waiting for? Monkey Lad is waiting for your help !
